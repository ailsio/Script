    <div class="main">
      <p>Jack and Max are walking to the church, to pray.</p>
      <p>Jack wonders whether it would be alright to smoke while praying.</p>
      <p>Max replies, “Why don’t you ask the Priest?”</p>
      <p>So Jack goes up to the Priest and asks, “Father, may I smoke while I pray?”</p>
      <p>The Priest replies, “No, my son, you may not! That’s utter disrespect to our religion.”</p>
      <p>Jack goes back to his friend and tells him what the good Priest told him.</p>
      <p>Max says, “I’m not surprised. You asked the wrong question. Let me try.”</p>
      <p>And so Max goes up to the Priest and asks,</p>
      <p>“Father, may I pray while I smoke?”</p>
      <p>To which the Priest eagerly replies, “By all means, my son. By all means. You can always pray whenever you want to.”</p>
      <p>Moral of the story: The approval you want depends on the way you ask for it.</p>
